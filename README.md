# Note-Taker
This Note Taker application will display a list of current notes and has add, delete, and edit features to make a new note, remove a note, and edit the content of a current note.
The app was created with React.js, Redux, Bootstrap, and Styled components on the front end while I used SQLite3 for the database. It was deployed using Netlify (front end) and Heroku (back end).

# How To Use
To test out the CRUD actions, simply click on "add  new note" on the side bar and make a new note. You can then click on that created note, or any of the existing notes, and either edit the content or delete the note from the list.
